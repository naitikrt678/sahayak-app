# üîß Upload Issues Fixed - Comprehensive Solution

## üìã Problem Diagnosis

The upload failures in your civic app are likely due to one or more of these common issues:

### 1. **Missing Storage Bucket** (Most Common)
- The "reports" bucket doesn't exist in Supabase Storage
- **Result**: Files fail to upload with "resource not found" error

### 2. **Row Level Security (RLS) Blocking Anonymous Users**
- Database has RLS enabled but no policies for anonymous inserts
- **Result**: Files upload successfully but database insertion fails

### 3. **App in Mock Mode**
- App settings configured to save locally instead of uploading
- **Result**: Reports appear to save but aren't actually uploaded

### 4. **Database Schema Missing/Incorrect**
- The "reports" table doesn't exist or has wrong structure
- **Result**: Database errors during report insertion

## üõ†Ô∏è Complete Solution

### Step 1: Run Upload Diagnostics
I've added a diagnostic tool to help identify issues:

1. **Open the app** (currently running on localhost)
2. **Go to Profile ‚Üí Upload Diagnostics**
3. **Review the diagnostic results** to see what's failing

### Step 2: Fix Supabase Storage
**Create the storage bucket:**

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Storage**
3. Click **"New Bucket"**
4. Name: **"reports"**
5. Set **Public: ON** (allows public read access to uploaded files)
6. Click **"Create Bucket"**

### Step 3: Fix Database Issues
**Run the SQL fix script:**

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the contents of `UPLOAD_FIX_SCRIPT.sql`
3. **Run the script** to:
   - Ensure reports table exists with correct structure
   - Temporarily disable RLS for testing
   - Verify table accessibility

### Step 4: Verify App Settings
**Check that app is in live mode:**

1. In the app, go to **Profile ‚Üí Settings**
2. Ensure **"Use Mock Data"** is **OFF**
3. App should show "Live Mode" for uploads to work

### Step 5: Test Upload
**Try uploading a report:**

1. **Take a photo** and fill out a report
2. **Submit the report**
3. **Check the diagnostic screen** to see upload progress
4. **Verify in Supabase Dashboard** that files and data appear

## üéØ Quick Fix for Immediate Testing

If you need uploads working right now, run this single SQL command in Supabase:

```sql
-- Temporarily disable security (TESTING ONLY)
ALTER TABLE reports DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This makes your table publicly writable. Only use for testing!

## üîç New Diagnostic Features Added

I've implemented a comprehensive diagnostic system:

### **Upload Diagnostic Screen** (`lib/screens/upload_diagnostic_screen.dart`)
- **Access**: Profile ‚Üí Upload Diagnostics
- **Checks**: Environment config, Supabase connection, storage bucket, database access
- **Features**: Real-time testing, detailed error messages, specific solutions

### **Upload Diagnostic Service** (`lib/services/upload_diagnostic_service.dart`)  
- **Tests**: All upload components automatically
- **Reports**: Pass/fail status with specific error details
- **Solutions**: Actionable steps to fix each issue

## üìö Documentation Created

### **Files Added**:
1. **`UPLOAD_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide
2. **`UPLOAD_FIX_SCRIPT.sql`** - SQL script to fix database issues  
3. **Upload diagnostic system** - Built-in app diagnostics

## ‚úÖ Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

1. **‚úÖ Storage bucket exists** and accepts file uploads
2. **‚úÖ Database accepts** report insertions from anonymous users  
3. **‚úÖ App uploads files** to Supabase Storage
4. **‚úÖ Reports appear** in Supabase dashboard
5. **‚úÖ Users receive** upload success confirmations

## üö® If Issues Persist

1. **Run the diagnostic tool** in the app
2. **Check specific error messages** in Flutter console
3. **Verify Supabase project status** is active
4. **Test with the SQL script** to ensure database access
5. **Check network connectivity** and Supabase API limits

## üéâ Production Recommendations

Once uploads work in testing:

1. **Re-enable RLS** with proper policies:
```sql
ALTER TABLE reports ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous insert reports" ON reports
    FOR INSERT TO anon WITH CHECK (true);
```

2. **Set up monitoring** for failed uploads
3. **Configure proper backup** strategies
4. **Test with real user data** at scale

The upload system is now equipped with comprehensive diagnostics and should work reliably once the Supabase configuration is complete!
