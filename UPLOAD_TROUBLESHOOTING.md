# Upload Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Upload Failure Causes & Solutions

### 1. ü™£ **Storage Bucket Issues**

**Problem**: The "reports" bucket doesn't exist in Supabase Storage.

**Symptoms**:
- Upload fails immediately
- Error: "The resource was not found"
- Storage connection test fails

**Solution**:
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. Create a new bucket named "reports"
3. Set the bucket to **Public** (for read access to uploaded files)
4. Configure bucket policies:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated and anonymous users to upload files
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('reports', 'reports', true);

-- Allow anyone to upload to images/ and audio/ folders
INSERT INTO storage.objects (bucket_id, name, owner)
VALUES ('reports', 'images/', null);

INSERT INTO storage.objects (bucket_id, name, owner) 
VALUES ('reports', 'audio/', null);
```

### 2. üîê **Database RLS Policy Issues**

**Problem**: Row Level Security blocks anonymous users from inserting reports.

**Symptoms**:
- Upload progresses but fails at database insertion
- Error: "new row violates row-level security policy"

**Solution**:
```sql
-- Disable RLS temporarily to test (NOT recommended for production)
ALTER TABLE reports DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- OR create proper RLS policies (RECOMMENDED)
ALTER TABLE reports ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Allow anonymous users to insert reports
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous insert reports" ON reports
    FOR INSERT TO anon
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow anonymous users to read their own reports
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous read reports" ON reports
    FOR SELECT TO anon
    USING (true);
```

### 3. üìä **Database Schema Issues**

**Problem**: The reports table doesn't exist or has wrong column types.

**Symptoms**:
- Error: "relation 'reports' does not exist"
- Error: "column 'xyz' does not exist"

**Solution**: Run the complete schema from `DATABASE_SCHEMA.sql`:

```sql
-- Create reports table with exact schema
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reports (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    request_id BIGINT UNIQUE NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('reports_id_seq'),
    serial_number SERIAL UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    category TEXT NOT NULL,
    area TEXT NOT NULL,
    time TEXT NOT NULL,
    date TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'in-process', 'completed')),
    description TEXT NOT NULL,
    geolocation_lat DECIMAL(10, 8) NOT NULL,
    geolocation_long DECIMAL(11, 8) NOT NULL,
    address TEXT NOT NULL,
    additional_notes TEXT,
    landmarks TEXT,
    urgency TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'medium' CHECK (urgency IN ('low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical')),
    image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    voice_url TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 4. üåê **Network & Connectivity Issues**

**Problem**: Network issues or API rate limits.

**Symptoms**:
- Intermittent upload failures
- Timeouts during upload
- "Network error" messages

**Solution**:
1. Check internet connectivity
2. Verify Supabase URL and API key in `.env`
3. Check Supabase project status
4. Implement retry logic (already implemented in upload queue)

### 5. üì± **App Configuration Issues**

**Problem**: App is in mock mode or wrong environment settings.

**Symptoms**:
- Upload appears successful but data isn't in Supabase
- Files saved locally only

**Solution**:
1. Check `.env` file:
```env
USE_MOCK_DATA=false
```

2. Or toggle in app: Profile ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí "Use Mock Data" = OFF

### 6. üîß **Upload Queue Problems**

**Problem**: Upload queue gets stuck or corrupted.

**Symptoms**:
- Reports stuck in "uploading" state
- Queue shows pending items but nothing happens

**Solution**:
```dart
// Clear upload queue (add this as a debug option)
await UploadQueueService.clearCompletedUploads();
await UploadQueueService.retryFailedUploads();
```

## üß™ **Testing Upload Functionality**

### Quick Test Checklist:
1. ‚úÖ Supabase URL and API key are correct
2. ‚úÖ "reports" bucket exists and is public
3. ‚úÖ "reports" table exists with correct schema
4. ‚úÖ RLS policies allow anonymous inserts
5. ‚úÖ App is in live mode (not mock mode)
6. ‚úÖ Internet connection is stable

### Debug Steps:
1. **Test Connection**: Go to Profile ‚Üí Supabase Status to see connection details
2. **Check Logs**: Look at Flutter console for specific error messages
3. **Test Upload**: Try uploading a simple report and monitor progress
4. **Verify Data**: Check Supabase Dashboard for uploaded files and database records

## üö® **Emergency Fixes**

### Quick Fix for Immediate Testing:
```sql
-- Temporary: Disable all security (UNSAFE - for testing only)
ALTER TABLE reports DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create bucket if missing
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('reports', 'reports', true) 
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

### Production-Ready Fix:
```sql
-- Enable proper RLS policies
ALTER TABLE reports ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Anonymous can insert reports" ON reports
    FOR INSERT TO anon
    WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can read all reports" ON reports
    FOR SELECT TO anon, authenticated
    USING (true);
```

## üìû **Getting Help**

If uploads still fail after these fixes:
1. Check the Flutter console for specific error messages
2. Verify Supabase Dashboard shows the bucket and table
3. Test with a simple curl request to isolate the issue
4. Check Supabase logs in the Dashboard ‚Üí Logs section

Most upload issues are resolved by ensuring the storage bucket exists and RLS policies allow anonymous users to insert data.
